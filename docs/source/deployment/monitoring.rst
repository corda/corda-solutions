Corda components such as Node, Bridge & Float write system messages to log files similar to many other platforms. These log files can be consumed and managed by commercially available data analysis platforms.

There is a detailed section on monitoring and available options here : https://docs.corda.r3.com/design/monitoring-management/design.html?highlight=monitoring
