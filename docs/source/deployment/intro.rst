On-Premises Deployment
======================

Corda uniquely enables P2P Corda Networking within the security constraints of corporate network architectures. Corda restricts access to Corda Nodes from peer Corda Nodes by way of valid identity certificates that are known in a Corda Network Map that is shared among accepted Nodes.

The chapters contained in this section are intended as guidelines for deploying Corda Enterprise and the Corda Enterprise Firewall for use in the Corda Network from an on-premises perspective. 

This document focuses primarily on on-premises deployment details & instructions on how to join the Corda Network. You may read more about joining the Corda Network here https://corda.network/.
