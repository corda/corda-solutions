S. Structure
------------

Our business network requires some sort of operating structure.  This may mean we are reusing, extending, or
repurposing, an existing organisation.  We may also be creating a new legal entity.  Activities in this section
aim to help establish a strawman structure.  More detailed needs are addressed in following sections.

S.1. Define Business Network Mission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Describe the purpose of the network. If existing, does repurposing the network on Corda alter the mission?
- Describe asset type(s) involved, exchanged, affected in the business transactions.
- Describe the participants at a high level (details covered later).

S.2. Assign Business Network Roles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Business Network Governor (BNG)?
- Business Network Operator (BNO)?
- If the BN already exists, are there roles already established that should be included or mapped to the above roles

S.3. Define the Governance Body Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Model structure, e.g., hierarchical, committee, etc.
- Responsibilities
