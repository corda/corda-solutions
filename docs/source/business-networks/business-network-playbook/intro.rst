Business Network Playbook
-------------------------

Having set the scene for Corda business networks, it is useful to think about specific tasks and their
implications for how any particular business network will commence, be governed, and operated.  We introduce these considerations in the form of a "playbook".

The playbook is not intended to be exhaustive, and is considered a living document.  More content will be added as
everyone gains insight into what makes for the recommended practices for all participants within a Corda business
network ecosystem.
